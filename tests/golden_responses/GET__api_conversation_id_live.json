      "content": "That's a genuinely complex question with a lot of variables. Let me break down the math and considerations:\n\n## Core Factors\n\n**Embedding generation** is usually the bottleneck:\n- Modern embedding models process ~1,000-10,000 docs/second on good GPUs\n- At 10k docs/sec: 22B docs = ~25 days of continuous processing\n- At 1k docs/sec: ~255 days\n\n**Index construction** (ChromaDB, FAISS, etc.):\n- Much faster than embedding generation\n- Can handle millions of vectors per hour once embedded\n- Usually not the limiting factor at scale\n\n## Real-World Scale Reference\n\n**The Pile** (825GB text corpus):\n- ~210B tokens \u2248 several billion \"documents\" depending on chunking\n- Major labs take weeks to months with massive GPU clusters\n\n**Your 22B scenario**:\n- Single machine with good GPU (A100): 1-3 months minimum\n- Small cluster (8-16 GPUs): 1-2 weeks\n- Enterprise scale (100+ GPUs): 2-5 days\n- Assumes efficient batching, pipeline optimization\n\n## Practical Constraints\n\n**Document size matters hugely:**\n- Short docs (tweets, messages): faster embedding\n- Long docs requiring chunking: significant overhead\n\n**Infrastructure costs:**\n- Renting GPU time at this scale: $50k-$500k+ depending on timeline\n- Cloud vs. local dramatically affects economics\n\n**Incremental approaches:**\n- Most real systems don't index everything at once\n- Rolling updates, priority queues, lazy indexing\n- Your DovOS sovereign corpus approach would likely use incremental strategies\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nWith solid infrastructure and optimization: **2-8 weeks** is realistic for a well-resourced team. Longer if you're bootstrap sovereign-style with limited hardware.\n\nWhat's the context? Are you thinking about corpus scale for DovOS, or is this related to a work/product architecture question?",
