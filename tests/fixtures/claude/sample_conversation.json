Here are the core principles for designing effective REST APIs:\n\nResource-Oriented Design:\n- Structure your API around resources (nouns) rather than actions (verbs)\n- Use standard HTTP verbs: GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PUT/PATCH for updates, DELETE for removal\n\nConsistent Naming:\n- Use plural nouns for collections: /api/users, /api/products\n- Use lowercase with hyphens for multi-word resources: /api/user-profiles\n\nHTTP Status Codes:\n- 200: Success\n- 201: Created\n- 204: No content\n- 400: Bad request\n- 401: Unauthorized\n- 404: Not found\n- 500: Server error\n\nVersion Your API:\n- Include version in URL: /api/v1/ or /api/v2/\n- This ensures backward compatibility\n\nPagination and Filtering:\n- Support pagination for large datasets: ?page=1&limit=20\n- Allow filtering: ?status=active&role=admin\n\nDocumentation:\n- Use tools like OpenAPI/Swagger\n- Document request/response examples\n- Explain error responses clearly\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these principles or discuss error handling strategies?",
